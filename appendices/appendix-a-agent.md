Appendix A — Illustrative Boundary Analysis: 

Agentic Tool Use
Across analyses of agentic systems capable of executing external actions, irreversible failures consistently cluster at the same structural location:

when execution proceeds without passing through an independent, non-executing review boundary

and when authority and remediation are assumed rather than explicit

This recurring pattern constitutes Final Verification Boundary Collapse.
