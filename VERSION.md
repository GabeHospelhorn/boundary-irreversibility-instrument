# Versioning — Boundary Irreversibility Instrument (BII)

This repository uses **spec-style versioning**.

The Boundary Irreversibility Instrument is a canonical specification.  
Version changes exist to protect semantic integrity, not to signal activity.

## Versioning Rules

### Major Version (X.0)
Increment **only** if any of the following change:
- Canonical primitives (boundary types, flow vectors, irreversibility markers)
- Capacity admissibility rule (C ≥ R)
- Boundary grammar or required ordering
- Definition or scope of Final Verification Boundary Collapse
- Interpretation of irreversibility or event horizon

A major version change indicates **non-backward-compatible semantic change**.

---

### Minor Version (1.X)
Increment if:
- New appendices are added
- Additional worked examples are included
- Explanatory text is expanded without altering meaning
- New instructional artifacts are introduced

Minor versions **do not change the instrument**.

---

### Patch Version (1.0.X)
Increment if:
- Typographical errors are corrected
- Formatting is adjusted
- Clarifying language is added without changing interpretation

Patch versions have **no semantic impact**.

## What Does *Not* Trigger a Version Change

- Reformatting for export (PDF, Word, HTML)
- Rendering changes
- Re-hosting or mirroring
- Commentary or secondary analysis outside this repository

---

## Current Version
